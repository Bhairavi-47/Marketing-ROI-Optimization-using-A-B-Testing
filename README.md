# Marketing-ROI-Optimization-using-A-B-Testing
End-to-end marketing analytics project comparing Facebook and AdWords performance using statistical A/B testing and predictive modeling. Provides actionable recommendations for strategic budget reallocation and ROI optimization

## Business Problem

In digital marketing, organizations invest heavily across multiple advertising platforms without clear evidence of which channel generates superior returns.

As a marketing analytics team, our objective is to evaluate and compare the performance of two advertising platforms — **Facebook Ads** and **AdWords Ads** — to determine which delivers higher conversions and better cost efficiency.

Without data-driven evaluation, marketing budgets risk being misallocated, reducing overall return on investment (ROI).

## Project Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Compare campaign performance between Facebook and AdWords
- Measure and analyze conversion effectiveness
- Evaluate cost efficiency across platforms
- Identify statistically significant differences in performance
- Provide strategic recommendations for optimal budget allocation

This project aims to support business **decision-making** through statistical analysis and marketing analytics.

2. Do higher ad clicks lead to proportionally higher conversions?
3. Is the difference in conversion performance statistically significant?
4. How does advertising cost influence conversion outcomes?
5. Is there a long-term equilibrium relationship between ad spend and conversions?
